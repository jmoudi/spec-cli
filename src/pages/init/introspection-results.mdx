# Introspection results

When a user gets started with Prisma in a **brownfield** project, they let Prisma introspect their database to generate the initial Prisma data model definition.

If they have chosen to use Photon, we want to provide them with an initial, lightweight setup so that they can already start exploring the Photon API without any additional overhead.

## Examples

For greenfield projects, we offer a selection of [_starter kits_](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/prisma2) to the user that they can select during `prisma2 init`. For brownfield projects, we eventually want to get to a similar level of sophistication and e.g. offer a to auto-generate a GraphQL server that's based on the existing database schema of the user.

Here's a list of (auto-generated) examples we want to eventually provide for brownfield projects:

- [Script](#script)
- [GraphQL API](#graphql-api)
- [REST API](#rest-api)

For now, we're starting with a simple script that demonstrates some Photon API calls against the existing database.

### Script

#### JavaScript

Use similar setup as in greenfield `script` example:

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`

#### TypeScript

Use similar setup as in greenfield `script` example:

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `tsconfig.json`

#### Heuristic for model selection

The `src/index.{js,ts}` should contain a Node/TypeScript script with some sample API calls. Since the data model is generated during the introspection, this script needs to be auto-generated. Here's a template for what it should look like:

```js
/**
 * 
 * This code was auto-generated based on the introspection result.
 * Consider it a playground to explore the Photon API.
 * Feel free to change it as much as you like or delete it altogether.
 *
 * The model `X` was randomly selected to demonstrate some API calls.
 *
 * Tip: Use the auto-completion of your editor to explore available API operations.
 * 
 */

const Photon = require('@generated/photon')
const photon = new Photon()

async function main() {
  // Tip: Explore some arguments to `findMany` 
  const allXs = await photon.xs.findMany()
  console.log(`Retrieved all published xs: `, allXs)

  // Comment out the lines below to create a new x
  // ATTENTION: This code creates a new record in your database
  // const newX = await photon.xs.create({
  //   data: {
  //     // all required values with random dummy data
  //   },
  // })
  // console.log(`Created a new x: `, newX)
}

main()
  .catch(e => console.error(e))
  .finally(async () => {
    await photon.disconnect()
  })
```

Note that `X` is a placeholder for any model from the data model that was generated via introspection. To ensure a great user experience, here's a heuristic how to select an appropriate model:

1. Prefer models without required relations. If there are only models with required relations, omit the `create` statement.
1. If any of the following models is present, use it (the order of the list determines the prefernce, i.e. `User` is preferred over `Player`, `Player` over `Customer`, ...): `User`, `Player`, `Customer`, `Product`, `Order`, `Article`, `Post`, `Message`
1. If none of the above models is present in the data model, select a model according to the following heuristic:
    1. The model name should not end on an `s`
    1. The model name should be in between 4 and 8 characters (if such a model doesn't exist, try 9, then 10, then 11, ...)
    1. The model should have between 2 and 6 _required_ fields (if such a model doesn't exist, try 7, then 8, then 9, ...)

As an example, consider that there was the following `User` model generated via introspection:

```prisma
model User {
  id         String @id
  name       String
  email      String
  isAdmin    Boolean @default(false)
  birthdate  DateTime?
}
```

This is the script to be generated:

```js
/**
 * 
 * This code was auto-generated based on the introspection result.
 * Consider it a playground to explore the Photon API.
 * Feel free to change it as much as you like or delete it altogether.
 *
 * The model `User` was randomly selected to demonstrate some API calls.
 * 
 * Tip: Use the auto-completion of your editor to explore available API operations.
 * 
 */

const Photon = require('@generated/photon')
const photon = new Photon()

async function main() {
  // Tip: Explore some arguments to `findMany` 
  const allUsers = await photon.users.findMany()
  console.log(`Retrieved all published users: `, allUsers)

  // Comment out the lines below to create a new user
  // ATTENTION: This code creates a new record in your database
  // const newUser = await photon.users.create({
  //   data: {
  //     name: "Z9rlkGhTS9",
  //     email: "kvZyPH5zFv"
  //   },
  // })
  // console.log(`Created a new x: `, newX)
}

main()
  .catch(e => console.error(e))
  .finally(async () => {
    await photon.disconnect()
  })
```
