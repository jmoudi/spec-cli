# Demo scripts

The _demo scripts_ come into play when a user selects the **Demo script** option at the end of the **Blank project** flow. 

If the user started out with introspecting a _non-empty_ database, then they will end up with a [generated demo script](./introspection-results).

If the user started out with an empty database, then we provide a Prisma schema with a basic data model and script for them that they can use to explore the Photon API. The script is based on the `script` ([TS](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/prisma2/typescript/script) & [JS](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/prisma2/javascript/script)) example from the [`prisma-examples`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/prisma2) but without the README files.
